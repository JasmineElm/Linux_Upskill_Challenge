# Linux Up-skill Challenge

This is my personal following of [https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge/](LinuxUpskillChallenge). It's not intended to replace, extend, or in any other way challenge the original course.  Instead I intend to:

1. document my experiences
2. expand some themes within the course
3. highlight some tips and tricks, and
4. collect some useful resources I've found

during following the course.
